/**
 * An even better duplication marking algorithm that handles all cases including clipped
 * and gapped alignments.
 * <p/>
 * This tool differs with MarkDuplicates as it may break ties differently.  Furthermore,
 * as it is a one-pass algorithm, it cannot know the program records contained in the file
 * that should be chained in advance.  Therefore it will only be able to examine the header
 * to attempt to infer those program group records that have no associated previous program
 * group record. If a read is encountered without a program record, or not one as previously
 * defined, it will not be updated.
 * <p/>
 * This tool will also not work with alignments that have large gaps or skips, such as those
 * from RNA-seq data.  This is due to the need to buffer small genomic windows to ensure
 * integrity of the duplicate marking, while large skips (ex. skipping introns) in the
 * alignment records would force making that window very large, thus exhausting memory.
