def: "Transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules are approximately 80 nucleotides in length. Their secondary structure includes four short double-helical elements and three loops (D, anti-codon, and T loops). Further hydrogen bonds mediate the characteristic L-shaped molecular structure. Transfer RNAs have two regions of fundamental functional importance: the anti-codon, which is responsible for specific mRNA codon recognition, and the 3' end, to which the tRNA's corresponding amino acid is attached (by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases). Transfer RNAs cope with the degeneracy of the genetic code in two manners: having more than one tRNA (with a specific anti-codon) for a particular amino acid; and 'wobble' base-pairing, i.e. permitting non-standard base-pairing at the 3rd anti-codon position."

The eukaryotic SRP consists of a 300-nucleotide 7S RNA and six proteins: SRPs 72, 68, 54, 19, 14, and 9. Archaeal SRP consists of a 7S RNA and homologues of the eukaryotic SRP19 and SRP54 proteins. In most eubacteria, the SRP consists of a 4.5S RNA and the Ffh protein (a homologue of the eukaryotic SRP54 protein). Eukaryotic and archaeal 7S RNAs have very similar secondary structures, with eight helical elements. These fold into the Alu and S domains, separated by a long linker region. Eubacterial SRP is generally a simpler structure, with the M domain of Ffh bound to a region of the 4.5S RNA that corresponds to helix 8 of the eukaryotic and archaeal SRP S domain. Some Gram-positive bacteria (e.g. Bacillus subtilis), however, have a larger SRP RNA that also has an Alu domain. The Alu domain is thought to mediate the peptide chain elongation retardation function of the SRP. The universally conserved helix which interacts with the SRP54/Ffh M domain mediates signal sequence recognition. In eukaryotes and archaea, the SRP19-helix 6 complex is thought to be involved in SRP assembly and stabilizes helix 8 for SRP54 binding." [http://www.sanger.ac.uk/cgi-bin/Rfam/getacc?RF00017]

They are large self-splicing ribozymes and have 6 structural domains (usually designated dI to dVI). A subset of group II introns also encode essential splicing proteins in intronic ORFs. The length of these introns can therefore be up to 3kb. Splicing occurs in almost identical fashion to nuclear pre-mRNA splicing with two transesterification steps. The 2' hydroxyl of a bulged adenosine in domain VI attacks the 5' splice site, followed by nucleophilic attack on the 3' splice site by the 3' OH of the upstream exon. Protein machinery is required for splicing in vivo, and long range intron to intron and intron-exon interactions are important for splice site positioning. Group II introns are further sub-classified into groups IIA and IIB which differ in splice site consensus, distance of bulged A from 3' splice site, some tertiary interactions, and intronic ORF phylogeny."

In eukaryotes, it is synthesised by RNA polymerase III (the other eukaryotic rRNAs are cleaved from a 45S precursor synthesised by RNA polymerase I). In Xenopus oocytes, it has been shown that fingers 4-7 of the nine-zinc finger transcription factor TFIIIA can bind to the central region of 5S RNA. Thus, in addition to positively regulating 5S rRNA transcription, TFIIIA also stabilizes 5S rRNA until it is required for transcription." [http://www.sanger.ac.uk/cgi-bin/Rfam/getacc?RF00001]

The in vivo synthesis confers a distinct advantage: the expressed sequences can enter both antigen presentation pathways, MHC I (inducing CD8+ T- cells, which are usually cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTL)) and MHC II (inducing CD4+ T-cells, usually 'T-helpers' (Th)); and can encounter B-cells, inducing antibody responses.

This orientation is slightly less stable because it introduces nonplanarity in the inter-strand hydrogen bonding pattern. Hydrogen bonding occurs between every other C=O from one strand to every other N-H on the adjacent strand. In this case, if two atoms C-alpha (i)and C-alpha (j) are adjacent in two hydrogen-bonded beta strands, then they do not hydrogen bond to each other; rather, one residue forms hydrogen bonds to the residues that flank the other (but not vice versa). For example, residue i may form hydrogen bonds to residues j - 1 and j + 1; this is known as a wide pair of hydrogen bonds. By contrast, residue j may hydrogen-bond to different residues altogether, or to none at all. The dihedral angles (phi, psi) are about (-120 degrees, 115 degrees) in parallel sheets."

The U3 snoRNA secondary structure is characterised by a small 5' domain (with boxes A and A'), and a larger 3' domain (with boxes B, C, C', and D), the two domains being linked by a single-stranded hinge. Boxes B and C form the B/C motif, which appears to be exclusive to U3 snoRNAs, and boxes C' and D form the C'/D motif. The latter is functionally similar to the C/D motifs found in other snoRNAs. The 5' domain and the hinge region act as a pre-rRNA-binding domain. The 3' domain has conserved protein-binding sites. Both the box B/C and box C'/D motifs are sufficient for nuclear retention of U3 snoRNA. The box C'/D motif is also necessary for nucleolar localization, stability and hypermethylation of U3 snoRNA. Both box B/C and C'/D motifs are involved in specific protein interactions and are necessary for the rRNA processing functions of U3 snoRNA." [http://www.sanger.ac.uk/cgi-bin/Rfam/getacc?RF00012]

This term was requested 2009-10-16 by Michel Dumontier, tracker id 2880747. \n\nFrom Janos Demeter: The only region shared by all chromosome ends, the X element core sequence is a small conserved element (~475 bp) that contains an ARS sequence and in most cases an Abf1p binding site. Between these is a GC-rich region nearly identical to the meiosis-specific regulatory sequence URS1.

def: "A codon variant that changes at least one base of the first codon of a transcript." [SO:ke]
comment: This is being used to annotate changes to the first codon of a transcript, when the first annotated codon is not to methionine. A variant is predicted to change the first amino acid of a translation irrespective of the fact that the underlying codon is an AUG. As such for transcripts with an incomplete CDS (sequence does not start with an AUG), it is still called.

comment: Mathematically defined repeat regions are determined without regard to the biological origin of the repetitive region. The repeat units of a MDR are the overlapping oligomers of size k that were used to for the query. Tools that can annotate mathematically defined repeats include Tallymer (Kurtz et al 2008, BMC Genomics: 517) and RePS (Wang et al, Genome Res 12(5): 824-831.).

def: "A 5' UTR variant where a premature start codon is introduced, moved or lost." [SANGER:am]
comment: Requested by Andy Menzies at the Sanger. This isn't necessarily a protein coding change. A premature start codon can effect the production of a mature protein product by providing a competing translation start point. Some genes balance their expression this way, eg THPO requires the presence of a premature start to limit expression, its loss leads to Familial thrombocythemia.

comment: MoRs are generated from miR hairpins that are longer and can produce two functional miR per strand. They are called moRs because they are not located next to the loop and thus their biogenesis process is a little different, but functionally, they are supposed to act like miRs. It is the same for loRs that are the loop fragments, they are generated differently than miRs or moRs but if loaded into the risc they are supposed to act the same way miRs do.\nRequested by Thomas Desvignes, Jan 2015.

comment: This term is to map to the ANNOVAR term 'ncRNA' http://annovar.openbioinformatics.org/en/latest/user-guide/gene/ . The description in the documentation (11/23/15) 'variant overlaps a transcript without coding annotation in the gene definition'. and this is further clarified in the document: ncRNA above refers to RNA without coding annotation. It does not mean that this is a RNA that will never be translated; it merely means that the user-selected gene annotation system was not able to give a coding sequence annotation. It could still code protein products and may have such annotations in future versions of gene annotation or in another gene annotation system. For example, BC039000 is regarded as ncRNA by ANNOVAR when using UCSC Known Gene annotation, but it is regarded as a protein-coding gene by ANNOVAR when using ENSEMBL annotation.  \n\nIt is further clarified in the comments section as: ncRNA does NOT mean conventional non-coding RNA. It means a RNA without complete coding sequence, and it can be a coding RNA that is annotated incorrectly by RefSeq or other gene definition systems.

comment: Requested by Pablo Cingolani. The way I calculate this is simply by looking at the PDB entry of one protein and then marking those AA that are within 3 Angstrom of each  other (and far away in the AA sequence, e.g. over 20 AA distance). The assumption is that, since they are very close in distance, they  must be "interacting" and thus important for protein structure.

def: "A gene_member_region that encodes sequence that directly contributes to the molecular function of its gene or gene product." [Clingen:mb]
comment: A functional_gene_region is a sequence feature that resides within a gene. But it is typically the corresponding region of translated/transcribed sequence in a gene product, that performs the molecular function qualifying it as a functional_gene_region. Here, a functional_gene_region must contribute directly to the molecular function of the gene product - regions that code for purely structural elements in a gene product that connect such directly functional elements together are not considered functional_gene_regions. Examples of regions considered 'functional' include those encoding enzymatic activity, binding activity, regions required for localization or membrane association, channel-forming regions, and signal peptides or other elements critical for processing of a gene product. In addition, regions that function at the genomic/DNA level are also included - e.g. regions of sequence known to be critical for binding transcription or splicing factors.

comment: Indels can have a different number of bases than the corresponding reference sequence. The term name was changed from indel to delins on 2/24/2019 to align with the HGVS nomenclature term for a deletion-insertion. Indel was causing confusion in the annotation community (github issue 445). The HGVS nomenclature definition of deletion-insertion (delins) is a sequence change where, compared to a reference sequence, one or more nucleotides are replaced by one or more other nucleotides and which is not a substitution, inversion or conversion.
