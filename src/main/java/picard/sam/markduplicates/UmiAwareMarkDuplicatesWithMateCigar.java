/**
 * This is a simple tool to mark duplicates making use of UMIs in the reads.
 *
 * It makes use of the fact that duplicate sets with UMIs can be broken up into subsets based on
 * information contained in the UMI.  Since UMIs may contain sequencing errors, this tool allows
 * for UMIs that are different but within a given edit distance to be considered to be part of the
 * same duplicate set.
 *
 * Users should continue to use MarkDuplicates in general, the main motivation for this tool is to provide a way to
 * mark duplicates using information from UMIs.
