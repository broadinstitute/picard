/**
 * <p>This tool takes a SAM/BAM file input and collects metrics that are specific for sequence
 * datasets generated through hybrid-selection. Hybrid-selection (HS) is the most commonly used technique to capture
 * exon-specific sequences for targeted sequencing experiments such as exome sequencing; for more information, please
 * see the corresponding <a href='http://www.broadinstitute.org/gatk/guide/article?id=6331'>GATK Dictionary entry</a>.</p>
 *
 * <p>This tool requires an aligned SAM or BAM file as well as bait and target interval files in Picard interval_list format.
 * You should use the bait and interval files that correspond to the capture kit that was used to generate the capture
 * libraries for sequencing, which can generally be obtained from the kit manufacturer. If the baits and target
 * intervals are provided in BED format, you can convert them to the Picard interval_list format using Picard's
 * <a href='http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/command-line-overview.html#BedToIntervalList'>BedToInterval</a> tool.</p>
 *
 * <p>If a reference sequence is provided, this program will calculate both AT_DROPOUT and GC_DROPOUT metrics. Dropout
 * metrics are an attempt to measure the reduced representation of reads, in regions that deviate from 50% G/C content.
 * This reduction in the number of aligned reads is due to the increased numbers of errors associated with sequencing
 * regions with excessive or deficient numbers of G/C bases, ultimately leading to poor mapping efficiencies and low
 * coverage in the affected regions.</p>
 *
 * <p>If you are interested in getting G/C content and mean sequence depth information for every target interval, use the
 * PER_TARGET_COVERAGE option.</p>
 *
 * <p>Note: Metrics labeled as percentages are actually expressed as fractions!</p>
 *
 * <h4>Usage Example:</h4>
 * <pre>
 * java -jar picard.jar CollectHsMetrics \\<br />
 *       I=input_reds.bam \\<br />
 *       O=output_hs_metrics.txt \\<br />"
