"see the corresponding <a href='http://www.broadinstitute.org/gatk/guide/article?id=6331'>GATK Dictionary entry</a>. </p> "+

"<p>This tool requires an aligned SAM or BAM file as well as bait and target interval files in Picard interval_list format. " +
"You should use the bait and interval files that correspond to the capture kit that was used to generate the capture " +
"libraries for sequencing, which can generally be obtained from the kit manufacturer. If the baits and target " +
"intervals are provided in BED format, you can convert them to the Picard interval_list format using Picard's " +
"<a href='http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/command-line-overview.html#BedToIntervalList'>BedToInterval</a> tool. </p>" +

"<p>If a reference sequence is provided, this program will calculate both AT_DROPOUT and GC_DROPOUT metrics. Dropout " +
"metrics are an attempt to measure the reduced representation of reads, in regions that deviate from 50% G/C content. " +
"This reduction in the number of aligned reads is due to the increased numbers of errors associated with sequencing " +
"regions with excessive or deficient numbers of G/C bases, ultimately leading to poor mapping efficiencies and low" +
"coverage in the affected regions. </p>" +

"<p>If you are interested in getting G/C content and mean sequence depth information for every target interval, use the " +
"PER_TARGET_COVERAGE option. </p>" +

"<p>Note: Metrics labeled as percentages are actually expressed as fractions!</p>  "+
