/**
 * Checks that all data in the set of input files appear to come from the same
 * individual. Can be used to compare according to readgroups, libraries, samples, or files.
 * Operates on bams/sams and vcfs (including gvcfs).
 *
 * <h3>Summary</h3>
 * Checks if all the genetic data within a set of files appear to come from the same individual.
 * It quickly determines whether a "group's" genotype matches that of an input SAM/BAM/VCF by selective sampling,
 * and has been designed to work well even for low-depth SAM/BAMs.
 * <br/>
 * The tool collects "fingerprints" (essentially genotype information from different parts of the genome)
 * at the finest level available in the data (readgroup for SAM files
 * and sample for VCF files) and then optionally aggregates it by library, sample or file, to increase power and provide
 * results at the desired resolution. Output is in a "Moltenized" format, one row per comparison. The results will
 * be emitted into a metric file for the class {@link CrosscheckMetric}.
 * In this format the output will include the LOD score and also tumor-aware LOD score which can
 * help assess identity even in the presence of a severe loss of heterozygosity with high purity (which could
 * otherwise fail to notice that samples are from the same individual.)
 * A matrix output is also available to facilitate visual inspection of crosscheck results.
 * <br/>
 * Since there can be many rows of output in the metric file, we recommend the use of {@link ClusterCrosscheckMetrics}
 * as a follow-up step to running CrosscheckFingerprints.
 * <br/>
 * There are cases where one would like to identify a few groups out of a collection of many possible groups (say
 * to link a bam to it's correct sample in a multi-sample vcf. In this case one would not case for the cross-checking
 * of the various samples in the VCF against each other, but only in checking the identity of the bam against the various
 * samples in the vcf. The {@link #SECOND_INPUT} is provided for this use-case. With {@link #SECOND_INPUT} provided, CrosscheckFingerprints
 * does the following:
 * <il>
 * <li>aggregation of data happens independently for the input files in {@link #INPUT} and {@link #SECOND_INPUT}.</li>
 * <li>aggregation of data happens at the SAMPLE level.</li>
 * <li>each samples from {@link #INPUT} will only be compared to that same sample in {@link #INPUT}.</li>
 * <li>{@link #MATRIX_OUTPUT} is disabled.</li>
 * </il>
 * <br/>
 * <h3>Examples</h3>
 * <h4>Check that all the readgroups from a sample match each other:</h4>
 * <pre>
 *     java -jar picard.jar CrosscheckFingerprints \
 *          INPUT=sample.with.many.readgroups.bam \
 *          HAPLOTYPE_DATABASE=fingerprinting_haplotype_database.txt \
 *          LOD_THRESHOLD=-5 \
 *          OUTPUT=sample.crosscheck_metrics
 * </pre>
 *
 *
 * <h4>Check that all the readgroups match as expected when providing reads from two samples from the same individual:</h4>
 * <pre>
 *     java -jar picard.jar CrosscheckFingerprints \
 *          INPUT=sample.one.with.many.readgroups.bam \
 *          INPUT=sample.two.with.many.readgroups.bam \
 *          HAPLOTYPE_DATABASE=fingerprinting_haplotype_database.txt \
 *          LOD_THRESHOLD=-5 \
 *          EXPECT_ALL_GROUPS_TO_MATCH=true \
 *          OUTPUT=sample.crosscheck_metrics
 * </pre>
 *
 *
 * <h3> Detailed Explanation</h3>
 *
 * This tool calculates the LOD score for identity check between "groups" of data in the INPUT files as defined by
 * the CROSSCHECK_BY argument. A positive value indicates that the data seems to have come from the same individual
 * or, in other words the identity checks out. The scale is logarithmic (base 10), so a LOD of 6 indicates
 * that it is 1,000,000 more likely that the data matches the genotypes than not. A negative value indicates
 * that the data do not match. A score that is near zero is inconclusive and can result from low coverage
 * or non-informative genotypes. Each group is assigned a sample identifier (for SAM this is taken from the SM tag in
 * the appropriate readgroup header line, for VCF this is taken from the column label in the file-header.
 * After combining all the data from the same "group" together, an all-against-all comparison is performed. Results are
 * categorized a {@link FingerprintResult} enum: EXPECTED_MATCH, EXPECTED_MISMATCH, UNEXPECTED_MATCH, UNEXPECTED_MISMATCH,
 * or AMBIGUOUS depending on the LOD score and on whether the sample identifiers of the groups agree: LOD scores that are
 * less than LOD_THRESHOLD are considered mismatches, and those greater than -LOD_THRESHOLD are matches (between is ambiguous).
 * If the sample identifiers are equal, the groups are expected to match. They are expected to mismatch otherwise.
 * <br/>
 *
 * The identity check makes use of haplotype blocks defined in the HAPLOTYPE_MAP file to enable it to have higher
 * statistical power for detecting identity or swap by aggregating data from several SNPs in the haplotype block. This
 * enables an identity check of samples with very low coverage (e.g. ~1x mean coverage).
 * <br/>
 * When provided a VCF, the identity check looks at the PL, GL and GT fields (in that order) and uses the first one that
 * it finds.
