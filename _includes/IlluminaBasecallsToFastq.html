<h3>IlluminaBasecallsToFastq</h3>
<section>
<p>Generate fastq file(s) from data in an Illumina basecalls output directory.
Separate fastq file(s) are created for each template read, and for each barcode read, in the basecalls.
Template fastqs have extensions like .<number>.fastq, where <number> is the number of the template read,
starting with 1.  Barcode fastqs have extensions like .barcode_<number>.fastq, where <number> is the number
of the barcode read, starting with 1.</p>
<table>
<tr><th>Option</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td>BASECALLS_DIR (File)</td><td>The basecalls directory.   Required. </td></tr>
<tr><td>BARCODES_DIR (File)</td><td>The barcodes directory with _barcode.txt files (generated by ExtractIlluminaBarcodes). If not set, use BASECALLS_DIR.   Default value: null. </td></tr>
<tr><td>LANE (Integer)</td><td>Lane number.   Required. </td></tr>
<tr><td>OUTPUT_PREFIX (File)</td><td>The prefix for output fastqs.  Extensions as described above are appended.  Use this option for a non-barcoded run, or for a barcoded run in which it is not desired to demultiplex reads into separate files by barcode.  Required.  Cannot be used in conjuction with option(s) MULTIPLEX_PARAMS</td></tr>
<tr><td>RUN_BARCODE (String)</td><td>The barcode of the run.  Prefixed to read names.  Required. </td></tr>
<tr><td>MACHINE_NAME (String)</td><td>The name of the machine on which the run was sequenced; required if emitting Casava1.8-style read name headers  Default value: null. </td></tr>
<tr><td>FLOWCELL_BARCODE (String)</td><td>The barcode of the flowcell that was sequenced; required if emitting Casava1.8-style read name headers  Default value: null. </td></tr>
<tr><td>READ_STRUCTURE (String)</td><td>A description of the logical structure of clusters in an Illumina Run, i.e. a description of the structure IlluminaBasecallsToSam assumes the  data to be in. It should consist of integer/character pairs describing the number of cycles and the type of those cycles (B for Barcode, T for Template, and S for skip).  E.g. If the input data consists of 80 base clusters and we provide a read structure of "36T8B8S28T" then, before being converted to SAM records those bases will be split into 4 reads where read one consists of 36 cycles of template, read two consists of 8 cycles of barcode, read three will be an 8 base read of skipped cycles and read four is another 28 cycle template read.  The read consisting of skipped cycles would NOT be included in output SAM/BAM file read groups.  Required. </td></tr>
<tr><td>MULTIPLEX_PARAMS (File)</td><td>Tab-separated file for creating all output fastqs demultiplexed by barcode for a lane with single IlluminaBasecallsToFastq invocation.  The columns are OUTPUT_PREFIX, and BARCODE_1, BARCODE_2 ... BARCODE_X where X = number of barcodes per cluster (optional).  Row with BARCODE_1 set to 'N' is used to specify an output_prefix for no barcode match.  Required.  Cannot be used in conjuction with option(s) OUTPUT_PREFIX (O)</td></tr>
<tr><td>ADAPTERS_TO_CHECK (IlluminaAdapterPair)</td><td>Which adapters to look for in the read.  Default value: [INDEXED, DUAL_INDEXED, NEXTERA_V2, FLUIDIGM]. This option can be set to 'null' to clear the default value. Possible values: {PAIRED_END, INDEXED, SINGLE_END, NEXTERA_V1, NEXTERA_V2, DUAL_INDEXED, FLUIDIGM, TRUSEQ_SMALLRNA, ALTERNATIVE_SINGLE_END} This option may be specified 0 or more times. This option can be set to 'null' to clear the default list. </td></tr>
<tr><td>NUM_PROCESSORS (Integer)</td><td>The number of threads to run in parallel. If NUM_PROCESSORS = 0, number of cores is automatically set to the number of cores available on the machine. If NUM_PROCESSORS &lt; 0, then the number of cores used will be the number available on the machine less NUM_PROCESSORS.  Default value: 0. This option can be set to 'null' to clear the default value. </td></tr>
<tr><td>FIRST_TILE (Integer)</td><td>If set, this is the first tile to be processed (used for debugging).  Note that tiles are not processed in numerical order.  Default value: null. </td></tr>
<tr><td>TILE_LIMIT (Integer)</td><td>If set, process no more than this many tiles (used for debugging).  Default value: null. </td></tr>
<tr><td>APPLY_EAMSS_FILTER (Boolean)</td><td>Apply EAMSS filtering to identify inappropriately quality scored bases towards the ends of reads and convert their quality scores to Q2.  Default value: true. This option can be set to 'null' to clear the default value. Possible values: {true, false} </td></tr>
<tr><td>FORCE_GC (Boolean)</td><td>If true, call System.gc() periodically.  This is useful in cases in which the -Xmx value passed is larger than the available memory.  Default value: true. This option can be set to 'null' to clear the default value. Possible values: {true, false} </td></tr>
<tr><td>MAX_READS_IN_RAM_PER_TILE (Integer)</td><td>Configure SortingCollections to store this many records before spilling to disk. For an indexed run, each SortingCollection gets this value/number of indices.  Default value: 1200000. This option can be set to 'null' to clear the default value. </td></tr>
<tr><td>MINIMUM_QUALITY (Integer)</td><td>The minimum quality (after transforming 0s to 1s) expected from reads.  If qualities are lower than this value, an error is thrown.The default of 2 is what the Illumina's spec describes as the minimum, but in practice the value has been observed lower.  Default value: 2. This option can be set to 'null' to clear the default value. </td></tr>
<tr><td>INCLUDE_NON_PF_READS (Boolean)</td><td>Whether to include non-PF reads  Default value: true. This option can be set to 'null' to clear the default value. Possible values: {true, false} </td></tr>
<tr><td>IGNORE_UNEXPECTED_BARCODES (Boolean)</td><td>Whether to ignore reads whose barcodes are not found in MULTIPLEX_PARAMS.  Useful when outputting fastqs for only a subset of the barcodes in a lane.  Default value: false. This option can be set to 'null' to clear the default value. Possible values: {true, false} </td></tr>
<tr><td>READ_NAME_FORMAT (ReadNameFormat)</td><td>The read name header formatting to emit.  Casava1.8 formatting has additional information beyond Illumina, including: the passing-filter flag value for the read, the flowcell name, and the sequencer name.  Default value: CASAVA_1_8. This option can be set to 'null' to clear the default value. Possible values: {CASAVA_1_8, ILLUMINA} </td></tr>
<tr><td>COMPRESS_OUTPUTS (Boolean)</td><td>Compress output FASTQ files using gzip and append a .gz extension to the file names.  Default value: false. This option can be set to 'null' to clear the default value. Possible values: {true, false} </td></tr>
