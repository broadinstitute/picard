<p>Subset read data from a SAM or BAM fileThis tool takes a SAM or BAM file and subsets it to a new file that either excludes or only includes either aligned or unaligned reads (set using FILTER), or specific reads based on a list of reads names supplied in the READ_LIST_FILE.  <h4>Usage example:</h4><pre>java -jar picard.jar FilterSamReads \<br />      I=input.bam \ <br />      O=output.bam \<br />      READ_LIST_FILE=read_names.txt \ <br />      FILTER=filter_value</pre> For information on the SAM format, please see: http://samtools.sourceforge.net<hr /></p>

<tr><th>Option</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td>INPUT (File)</td><td>The SAM or BAM file that will be filtered.  Required. </td></tr>
<tr><td>FILTER (Filter)</td><td>Filter.  Required. Possible values: {includeAligned [OUTPUT SAM/BAM will contain aligned reads only. INPUT SAM/BAM must be in queryname SortOrder. (Note that *both* first and second of paired reads must be aligned to be included in the OUTPUT SAM or BAM)], excludeAligned [OUTPUT SAM/BAM will contain un-mapped reads only. INPUT SAM/BAM must be in queryname SortOrder. (Note that *both* first and second of pair must be aligned to be excluded from the OUTPUT SAM or BAM)], includeReadList [OUTPUT SAM/BAM will contain reads that are supplied in the READ_LIST_FILE file], excludeReadList [OUTPUT bam will contain reads that are *not* supplied in the READ_LIST_FILE file], includeJavascript [OUTPUT bam will contain reads that hava been accepted by the JAVASCRIPT_FILE script.]} </td></tr>
<tr><td>READ_LIST_FILE (File)</td><td>Read List File containing reads that will be included or excluded from the OUTPUT SAM or BAM file.  Default value: null. </td></tr>
<tr><td>SORT_ORDER (SortOrder)</td><td>SortOrder of the OUTPUT SAM or BAM file, otherwise use the SortOrder of the INPUT file.  Default value: null. Possible values: {unsorted, queryname, coordinate, duplicate} </td></tr>
<tr><td>WRITE_READS_FILES (Boolean)</td><td>Create .reads files (for debugging purposes)  Default value: true. This option can be set to 'null' to clear the default value. Possible values: {true, false} </td></tr>
<tr><td>OUTPUT (File)</td><td>SAM or BAM file to write read excluded results to  Required. </td></tr>
<tr><td>JAVASCRIPT_FILE (File)</td><td>Filters a SAM or BAM file with a javascript expression using the java javascript-engine.  The script puts the following variables in the script context:  'record' a SamRecord ( https://samtools.github.io/htsjdk/javadoc/htsjdk/htsjdk/samtools/SAMRecord.html ) and  'header' a SAMFileHeader ( https://samtools.github.io/htsjdk/javadoc/htsjdk/htsjdk/samtools/SAMFileHeader.html ). Last value of the script should be a boolean to tell wether we should accept or reject the record.  Default value: null. </td></tr>
