<p>Collect mean quality by cycle.This tool generates a data table and chart of mean quality by cycle from a BAM file. It is intended to be used on a single lane or read group's worth of data, but can be applied to merged BAMs if needed. <br /><br />This metric gives an overall snapshot of sequencing machine performance. For most types of sequencing data, the output is expected to show a slight reduction in overall base quality scores towards the end of each read. Spikes in quality within reads are not expected and may indicate that technical problems occurred during sequencing.<br /><br /><h4>Usage example:</h4><pre>java -jar picard.jar MeanQualityByCycle \<br />      I=input.bam \<br />      O=mean_qual_by_cycle.txt \<br />      CHART=mean_qual_by_cycle.pdf</pre><hr /></p>

<tr><th>Option</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td>CHART_OUTPUT (File)</td><td>A file (with .pdf extension) to write the chart to.  Required. </td></tr>
<tr><td>ALIGNED_READS_ONLY (Boolean)</td><td>If set to true, calculate mean quality over aligned reads only.  Default value: false. This option can be set to 'null' to clear the default value. Possible values: {true, false} </td></tr>
<tr><td>PF_READS_ONLY (Boolean)</td><td>If set to true calculate mean quality over PF reads only.  Default value: false. This option can be set to 'null' to clear the default value. Possible values: {true, false} </td></tr>
<tr><td>INPUT (File)</td><td>Input SAM or BAM file.  Required. </td></tr>
<tr><td>OUTPUT (File)</td><td>File to write the output to.  Required. </td></tr>
<tr><td>ASSUME_SORTED (Boolean)</td><td>If true (default), then the sort order in the header file will be ignored.  Default value: true. This option can be set to 'null' to clear the default value. Possible values: {true, false} </td></tr>
<tr><td>STOP_AFTER (Long)</td><td>Stop after processing N reads, mainly for debugging.  Default value: 0. This option can be set to 'null' to clear the default value. </td></tr>
