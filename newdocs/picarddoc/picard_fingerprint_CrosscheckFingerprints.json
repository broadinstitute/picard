  "summary": "Checks the odds that all data in the set of input files come from the same individual. Can be used to cross-check readgroups, libraries, samples, or files. Acceptable inputs include BAM/SAM/CRAM and VCF/GVCF files. Output delivers LOD scores in the form of a CrosscheckMetric file. \n\n\u003ch3\u003eSummary\u003c/h3\u003e\nCrosscheckFingerprints rapidly checks the odds that all of the genetic data within a set of files come from the same individual. This is accomplished by selectively sampling from the input files, and determining whether the genotypes of the specified Groups match to each other. (Groups are defined by the input and the argument CROSSCHECK_BY; they can be READ_GROUP, LIBRARY, SAMPLE, or FILE.)\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e Output is generated in the form of a “molten” (one row per comparison) CrosscheckMetric file that includes the Logarithm of the Odds (LOD) score, as well as the tumor-aware LOD score. Tumor-aware LOD scores can be used to assess genotypic identity in the presence of a severe Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH) with high purity—this could otherwise lead to a failure of the tool to identify samples are from the same individual. Output is also available as a matrix, to facilitate visual inspection of crosscheck results.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e Metric files can contain many rows of output. We therefore recommend following up CrosscheckFingerprints with a step using [ClusterCrosscheckMetrics (Picard)](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360045798972--Tool-Documentation-Index); this tool will cluster groups together that pass a designated LOD threshold, ensuring that groups within the cluster are related to each other. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e There may be cases where several groups out of a collection of possible groups must be identified---for example, to link a BAM to its correct sample in a multi-sample VCF. In this case, it would not be necessary to cross-check the various samples in the VCF against each other, but only to check the identity of the BAM against the various samples in the VCF. For this application, the SECOND_INPUT argument is provided. With SECOND_INPUT, CrosscheckFingerprints can do the following: \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e \u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e Independently aggregate data for the input files in INPUT and SECOND_INPUT. \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e Aggregate data at the SAMPLE level. \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e Compare samples from INPUT to the same sample in SECOND_INPUT. \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e Disables MATRIX_OUTPUT. \u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eIn some cases, the groups collected may not have any observations (‘reads’ for BAM files, or ‘calls’ for VCF files) at fingerprinting sites. Alternatively, a sample in INPUT may be missing from SECOND_INPUT. These cases are handled as follows: \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e \u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e If running in CHECK_SAME_SAMPLES mode with the INPUT and SECOND_INPUT sets of input files: when either set of inputs (1) includes a sample not found in the other, or (2) contains a sample with no observations at any fingerprinting sites, then an error will be logged and the tool will return EXIT_CODE_WHEN_MISMATCH. \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e If running in any other running mode: when a group which is being crosschecked does not have any observations at fingerprinting sites, a warning will be logged. \u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eNote that, as long as there is at least one comparison in which both files have observations at fingerprinting sites, the tool will return a ‘zero’. However, an error will be logged and the tool will return EXIT_CODE_WHEN_NO_VALID_CHECKS if all comparisons have at least one side without observations at a fingerprinting site (ie. all LOD scores are zero). \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e \u003chr/\u003e\u003ch3\u003eExamples\u003c/h3\u003e\u003ch4\u003eCheck that all the readgroups from a sample match each other:\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cpre\u003e    java -jar picard.jar CrosscheckFingerprints \\\n          INPUT\u003dsample.with.many.readgroups.bam \\\n          HAPLOTYPE_MAP\u003dfingerprinting_haplotype_database.txt \\\n          LOD_THRESHOLD\u003d-5 \\\n          OUTPUT\u003dsample.crosscheck_metrics \u003c/pre\u003e\n \u003ch4\u003eCheck that all the readgroups match as expected when providing reads from two samples from the same individual:\u003c/h4\u003e \u003cpre\u003e     java -jar picard.jar CrosscheckFingerprints \\\n           INPUT\u003dsample.one.with.many.readgroups.bam \\\n           INPUT\u003dsample.two.with.many.readgroups.bam \\\n           HAPLOTYPE_MAP\u003dfingerprinting_haplotype_database.txt \\\n           LOD_THRESHOLD\u003d-5 \\\n           EXPECT_ALL_GROUPS_TO_MATCH\u003dtrue \\\n           OUTPUT\u003dsample.crosscheck_metrics \u003c/pre\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ch4\u003eDetailed Explanation\u003c/h4\u003e\nThis tool calculates the LOD score for identity check between \"groups\" of data in the INPUT files as defined by the CROSSCHECK_BY argument. A positive value indicates that the data seems to have come from the same individual or, in other words the identity checks out. The scale is logarithmic (base 10), so a LOD of 6 indicates that it is 1,000,000 more likely that the data matches the genotypes than not. A negative value indicates that the data do not match. A score that is near zero is inconclusive and can result from low coverage or non-informative genotypes. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eEach group is assigned a sample identifier (for SAM this is taken from the SM tag in the appropriate readgroup header line, for VCF this is taken from the column label in the file-header. After combining all the data from the same group together, an all-against-all comparison is performed. Results are categorized as one of EXPECTED_MATCH, EXPECTED_MISMATCH, UNEXPECTED_MATCH, UNEXPECTED_MISMATCH, or AMBIGUOUS depending on the LOD score and on whether the sample identifiers of the groups agree: LOD scores that are less than LOD_THRESHOLD are considered mismatches, and those greater than -LOD_THRESHOLD are matches (between is ambiguous). If the sample identifiers are equal, the groups are expected to match. They are expected to mismatch otherwise. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe identity check makes use of haplotype blocks defined in the HAPLOTYPE_MAP file to enable it to have higher statistical power for detecting identity or swap by aggregating data from several SNPs in the haplotype block. This enables an identity check of samples with very low coverage (e.g. ~1x mean coverage).\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eWhen provided a VCF, the identity check looks at the PL, GL and GT fields (in that order) and uses the first one that it finds.

  "description": "Checks that all data in the set of input files appear to come from the same \n individual. Can be used to compare according to readgroups, libraries, samples, or files. \n Operates on bams/sams and vcfs (including gvcfs). \n\n \u003ch3\u003eSummary\u003c/h3\u003e\n Checks if all the genetic data within a set of files appear to come from the same individual. \n It quickly determines whether a \"group\u0027s\" genotype matches that of an input SAM/BAM/VCF by selective sampling, \n and has been designed to work well even for low-depth SAM/BAMs. \n \u003cbr/\u003e\n The tool collects \"fingerprints\" (essentially genotype information from different parts of the genome) \n at the finest level available in the data (readgroup for SAM files \n and sample for VCF files) and then optionally aggregates it by library, sample or file, to increase power and provide \n results at the desired resolution. Output is in a \"Moltenized\" format, one row per comparison. The results will \n be emitted into a metric file for the class {@link CrosscheckMetric}. \n In this format, the output will include both the LOD score and the tumor-aware LOD score; the latter can \n help assess identity even in the presence of a severe loss of heterozygosity with high purity (the tool could \n otherwise fail to notice that samples are from the same individual.) \n A matrix output is also available to facilitate visual inspection of crosscheck results. \n \u003cbr/\u003e\n Since there can be many rows of output in the metric file, we recommend the use of {@link ClusterCrosscheckMetrics} \n as a follow-up step to running CrosscheckFingerprints. \n \u003cbr/\u003e\n There are cases where one would like to identify a few groups out of a collection of many possible groups (say \n to link a bam to its correct sample in a multi-sample vcf. In this case, one would not care for the cross-checking \n of the various samples in the VCF against each other, but only in checking the identity of the bam against the various \n samples in the vcf. The {@link #SECOND_INPUT} is provided for this use-case. With {@link #SECOND_INPUT} provided, \n CrosscheckFingerprints does the following: \n \u003cil\u003e\n \u003cli\u003eaggregation of data happens independently for the input files in {@link #INPUT} and {@link #SECOND_INPUT}.\u003c/li\u003e\n \u003cli\u003eaggregation of data happens at the SAMPLE level.\u003c/li\u003e\n \u003cli\u003eeach sample from {@link #INPUT} will only be compared to that same sample in {@link #INPUT}.\u003c/li\u003e\n \u003cli\u003e{@link #MATRIX_OUTPUT} is disabled.\u003c/li\u003e\n \u003c/il\u003e\n \u003cbr/\u003e\n In some cases, the groups collected may not have any observations (calls for a vcf, reads for a bam) at fingerprinting \n sites, or a sample in INPUT may be missing from the SECOND_INPUT. These cases are handled as follows:  If running in \n CHECK_SAME_SAMPLES mode with INPUT and SECOND_INPUT, and either INPUT or SECOND_INPUT includes a sample not found in the \n other, or contains a sample with no observations at any fingerprinting sites, an error will be logged and the tool will \n return EXIT_CODE_WHEN_MISMATCH.\n In all other running modes, when any group which is being crosschecked does not have any observations at fingerprinting \n sites, a warning is logged.  As long as there is at least one comparison where both sides have observations at \n fingerprinting sites, the tool will return zero.  However, if all comparisons have at least one side with no observations\n at fingerprinting sites, an error will be logged and the tool will return EXIT_CODE_WHEN_NO_VALID_CHECKS.\n \u003ch3\u003eExamples\u003c/h3\u003e\n \u003ch4\u003eCheck that all the readgroups from a sample match each other:\u003c/h4\u003e\n \u003cpre\u003e\n     java -jar picard.jar CrosscheckFingerprints \\\n          INPUT\u003dsample.with.many.readgroups.bam \\\n          HAPLOTYPE_MAP\u003dfingerprinting_haplotype_database.txt \\\n          LOD_THRESHOLD\u003d-5 \\\n          OUTPUT\u003dsample.crosscheck_metrics\n \u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n \u003ch4\u003eCheck that all the readgroups match as expected when providing reads from two samples from the same individual:\u003c/h4\u003e\n \u003cpre\u003e\n     java -jar picard.jar CrosscheckFingerprints \\\n          INPUT\u003dsample.one.with.many.readgroups.bam \\\n          INPUT\u003dsample.two.with.many.readgroups.bam \\\n          HAPLOTYPE_MAP\u003dfingerprinting_haplotype_database.txt \\\n          LOD_THRESHOLD\u003d-5 \\\n          EXPECT_ALL_GROUPS_TO_MATCH\u003dtrue \\\n          OUTPUT\u003dsample.crosscheck_metrics\n \u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n \u003ch3\u003e Detailed Explanation\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n This tool calculates the LOD score for identity check between \"groups\" of data in the INPUT files as defined by\n the CROSSCHECK_BY argument. A positive value indicates that the data seems to have come from the same individual\n or, in other words, the identity checks out. The scale is logarithmic (base 10), so a LOD of 6 indicates\n that it is 1,000,000 times more likely that the data matches the genotypes than not. A negative value indicates\n that the data do not match. A score that is near zero is inconclusive and can result from low coverage\n or non-informative genotypes. Each group is assigned a sample identifier (for SAM this is taken from the SM tag in\n the appropriate readgroup header line, for VCF this is taken from the column label in the file-header.\n After combining all the data from the same \"group\" together, an all-against-all comparison is performed. Results are\n categorized as a {@link FingerprintResult} enum: EXPECTED_MATCH, EXPECTED_MISMATCH, UNEXPECTED_MATCH, UNEXPECTED_MISMATCH,\n or AMBIGUOUS depending on the LOD score and on whether the sample identifiers of the groups agree: LOD scores that are\n less than LOD_THRESHOLD are considered mismatches, and those greater than -LOD_THRESHOLD are matches (between is ambiguous).\n If the sample identifiers are equal, the groups are expected to match. They are expected to mismatch otherwise.\n \u003cbr/\u003e\n\n The identity check makes use of haplotype blocks defined in the HAPLOTYPE_MAP file to enable it to have higher\n statistical power for detecting identity or swap by aggregating data from several SNPs in the haplotype block. This\n enables an identity check of samples with very low coverage (e.g. ~1x mean coverage).\n \u003cbr/\u003e\n When provided a VCF, the identity check looks at the PL, GL and GT fields (in that order) and uses the first one that\n it finds.\n@author Tim Fennell\n@author Yossi Farjoun",
